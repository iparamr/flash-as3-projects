Please find the same prototype running at the link

WA2

The wA project uses a mySQL database via PHP...

you can see it working at 

http://oa-s139-07.sheridanc.on.ca/wa2/assignments/RateADay.html

"rate_a_day.php" has the PHP code required for the database stuff.



Please feel free to e-mail me if you have any questions
